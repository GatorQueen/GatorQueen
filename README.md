### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I try to incorporate all of my interests in my coding. Currently, I'm working on a database that encompasses my large crystal collection, and I hope to unveil it to other individuals of similar interest! I also decided to take a herbal plant medicine class to learn more about natural healing.
I'm a mixed-media artist. In my spare time, I crochet and create cross-stitch patterns.
